# NBA_GOAT_Ranking

The purpose of this doc is a training excercise to get me back into coding.
I will be pulling statistics from Basketball reference to compile average statistics
and accolades from all players. Then sort these accolades into a local database which
I can pull from later. From this I will use these stats to form a top 100
list for all-time. This list will be impersonal and unbiased although I may
mess with the algorithm to better fit perception once the algorithm is working.
